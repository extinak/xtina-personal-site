                    <h1>CHARACTER CREATION</h1>
                    <h2>Old School Essentials</h2>
                    <p>- is the game we are playing, unless I say otherwise.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Generator</h2>                    
                    <p>Use <a href="https://dndcharacter.com/"> this website</a> to generate your character.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Things to note</h2>
                    <h3>Class/Race Options</h3>
                    <p>Use the Classic Fantasy options for now, as well as "race-as-class", so your options are:</p>
                    <p>Cleric, Dwarf, Elf, Fighter, Halfling, Magic-User, Thief.</p>
                    <p>This will probably change later.</p>
                    <h3>Encumbrance</h3>
                    <p>I use default encumbrance rules for OSE (don't worry, they are straight-forward and easier to use than the versions used in recent editions of dnd.)</p>
                    <h3>Languages</h3>
                    <p>Instead of "common", take Phaedren as your default language.<p>
                    <p>Choose your extra languages from ones in the <a href="https://xtina-is-rad.neocities.org/rpg-stuff/gazetteer.html">Gazetteer</a> based on what makes sense for your character rather than the list included with OSE.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Setting race changes</h2>
                    <p>This section will get more filled out over time, right now here are a few things to know about playing Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Lizardfolk, Beastmen, or anything else that comes up later.</p>
                    <h3>Elves</h3>
                    <p>The default Elf class will probably fully be replaced by the Dolmenwood version when that setting comes out.</p>
                    <p>For now, just now that elves in this setting are otherworldly-fae from the realm of Faerie. There are many types of elves in the world (such as Frost Elves, Summer Elves, etc) and yours can look as otherworldly as you like, and you can make up a 'type' if you like, or I can give you some options</p>
                    <p>Mechanics-wise, replace the extra languages (Gnoll, Hobgoblin, Orcish) with Sylvan, High Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.</p>
                    <h3>Dwarves</h3>
                    <p>Honestly I have come up with anything special for dwarves, just play them as standard dwarves for now.</p>
                    <p>Mechanics-wise, replace the extra languages (Gnomish, Goblin, Kobold) with three languages of your choice.</p>
                    <h3>Halflings</h3>
                    <p>No changes.</p>
                    <h3>Lizardfolk</h3>
                    <p>Not playable yet, but they will be eventually. Let me know if you are hankering to play one. (the actual class is done, you would just need to write your character sheet by hand instead of using the generator).</p>
                    <h3>Beastmen</h3>
                    <p>"Beastmen" encompasses Gnolls and similar mammalian anthromorphic species.</p>
                    <p>Not playable yet, same explanation as Lizardfolk.</p>
