                    <h1>RPG INFO</h1>
                    <p>If you are reading this, then Xtina has probably decided she wants to play an rpg with you. Congrats!</p>
                    <h2>1. Expectations (for you and your GM)</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Games are for chilling with my buds</h3>
                    <p>I play RPGs primarily to hang out with people. I love telling stories alongside people and doing crunchy shit, but for me it's a means to hangout with people I love or want to get to know better.</p>
                    <h3>Let's not avoid conflict</h3>
                    <p>Conflicts may come up: I'd prefer to be a table where conflict is addressed rather than avoided. Please talk or message me if I am missing a vibe during the game or something is bugging you.</p>
                    <h3>Always safety tools</h3>
                    <p>We'll always play with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit">x-cards</a> by default.</p>
                    <h3>Low commitment affairs</h3>
                    <p>My games tend to be lighter affairs and generally you do not need to do prep beforehand and you do not need to commit to playing more than one game. I'd love you to come back, but let's just play one fun session together to start.</p>
                    <h3>I'll organize games but help me out later</h3>
                    <p>If we haven't played before, I'll organize a time for you to play and get you connected with people who I think you will like. After we've played for a bit, I would love if you would start coordinating your own sessions. You'll understand what I mean once we play a bit.</p>
                    <h3>Tell me your cool idea</h3>
                    <p>If you do want to do a bunch of writing about something or have a cool idea, please share it! That's rad, I won't ever stomp on your passions.</p>

                    <h2>2. Game Format</h2>
                        
                    <h3>Open Table</h3>
                    <p>The main way I am running games right now is an 'open table'. Players can drop into adventures and multiple different excursions are taking place across the land. There isn't really a core 'story' happening yet (that may change depending on what players get interested in).
            
                    <h2>3. Principles for "OSR"-style play</h2>
                    
                    <a href="https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html">This document</a> is a big inspiration in how I like to run games these days. I recommend reading the player principles at the end of the document at least.                   
                        
                    <h2>Addendum: Character Death</h2>
                    <sup>I always accidentally write "player death" when I mean to write "character death". What does that say about me?</sup>
                    
                    <h3>Your character has a not-insignificant chance to die</h3>
                    <p>One factor in the games I like to run is I like to kill characters. Errrr, I mean. Well, it's not untrue. We're generally going to play games where your characters stay pretty vulnerable and you need to take active
                    means to stay alive. I'll telegraph danger, but deaths to happen, and every player in the game right now has had at least 1 character die.</p>
                    <h3>This is why new characters are quick to make</h3>
               		<p>This is also why I'll make it fast and easy to generate a new character, and importantly to me, the deaths that have happened are <em>part of the story</em>. Character victories, struggles, and deaths are the narratives that we are constructing together.</p> 
                    <h3>Sorry in advance</h3>
               		<p>I fully understand that this won't appeal to every player, but I'd rather you know up front what you are getting into</p>
