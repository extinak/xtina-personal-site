                    <h1>GAZETTEER</h1>
                    <h2>Important Note!</h2>
                    <p>Much of the gazetteer has been inspired by ideas or impromptu character backstories from players during the game. Consider this world to be as much yours as it is mine!</p>
                    <h2>How to use</h2>
                    <h3>Factions</h3>
                    <p>You can decide your character is a member of one of these factions if you like, otherwise this is information your character would likely know and could take advantage of.</p>
                    <p>If all else fails, your character can always find work with a faction!</p>
                    <h3>Regions</h3>
                    <p>Phaedra and (to a lesser extent) Dolmenwood are the main playable regions of the game.</p>
                    <p>You are free to create a character from one of these regions, or from somewhere else if you feeling like making something up.</p>
                    <h3>Distant Lands</h3>
                    <p>A small selection of other areas in the world. Feel free to riff on these or come up with your own if you like!</p>
                    <h3>Languages</h3>
                    <p>If your class or intelligence gives you bonus languages, you can choose from the common or uncommon languages freely and the rare languages with permission (usually okay if your character has a reason to know it).</p>                
                    <hr/>
                    <h2>Factions</h2>
                    <h3>The Cult of Apollo</h3>
                    <p>A militarized cult dedicated to the god Apollo and spiritual leaders of the old faith. They are among those who helped usher back the old faith to Phaedra. Their military cult is in charge of the city of Argope, which houses Apollo himself. Have entered a ceasefire with the empire and somewhat hostile to the Church of the One True God, and tentative allies of the Northern Covenant.</p>
                    <h3>The Northern Covenant</h3>
                    <p>An alliance between the native witches, halflings, and dwarves of Phaedra, blessed by the goddess Hekate. Led by a triumvirate of the leaders of the 3 groups (eldest witch, dwarven queen, and halfing mayor). Occupies northern Phaedra, a cold and forested province that borders the Dolmenwood. Allied to the Cult of Apollo. The Church still has presence in the north and the triumvirate keeps ties with the noble houses in Dolmenwood, to the east.
                    <h3>Church of the One True God</h3>
                    <p>The dominant religion in the great sea and the surrounding areas. Heavily tied to the great empire Voltalia in the south. The Church has been pushed out of Phaedra by the rise of the old faith but actively seeks to bring the good word back to the region. 
                    <h3>Beastmen and Lizardfolk</h3>
                    <p>Rarely, beastmen and lizardfolk will depart from murder island, seeking mercenary work. Not much is known about them.</p>
                    <h3>Voltalia, The Great Empire</h3>
                    <p>The Great Empire, savior of lessor peoples and barbarians and gracious victor of the great sea. Voltalia's size and population acts as a gravitational pull of trade and resources to its huge cities surrounding the great sea. Seeks to bring order back to Phaedra and bring the Church of the One True God with it.</p>

                    <p>The old faith has returned to the land, helping rid the area of the church of the One True God and the empire.</p>
                    
                    <p>The changes in the power and the return on the old faith has awoken ancient shrines and lost ruins, bringing both new fortunes and new troubles to the recovering nation.</p>
