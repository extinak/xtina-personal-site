               		religon (if you can call it that) of the area is based on the ancient greek pantheon and mythologies.

               		Some other important bits for you to know are:

               		1. The world is full of black and brown people, including elves, dwarves, gnomes, and etc.
               		2. There are lots of gay, trans, ace, polyam, aro, and maybe even some straight folks if we're feelin' wild. This is going to be the default
               		3. There might be groups that are projections of real-life shitty groups in the world today but those groups won't have goals based on real-life cultural groups. There's not going to be racists, sexists, or antisemities,
               		but there might be groups that hate sex and masturbation and fantasy species-ists. 
               		4. "Monsterous" races are people. There's no default evil/chaotic people here.
               		5. The world (this region at least) uses Greek mythology, but the gods are as distant as they are in our world. You aren't going to see Zeus walking around trying to fuck a sheep. I think the concept of greek mysteries
               		and heresies in general to be interesting, so plan to see some of that. Some myths might be recontextualized to fit in the setting but feel free to include any obsucure greek myths that you know. I am not expert on the matter,
               		this has just sort of happened and I am rolling with it. 
               		6. Clerics don't dedicate themselves to a specific deity, since that doesn't really make sense for a polythetisitc society. I've been writing some alternate rules for this and those may come up later.
					7. Slavers do exist in this settings, feel free to try to murder them. Heck, feel inspiried to try to take down any evil organization in the settings, 
					whether or not it appears to you to be an explict plot hook. (Hint, there are no plot hooks)
