                    <p>If you are reading this, then Xtina has probably decided she wants to play an rpg with you. Congrats!</p>
                    1. Expectations (for you and your GM)

                    RPGs (and interacting with human-kind in general) can be messy endevors. I don't promise that nothing will come up, but I'll do my best to deal with it if it does.

                    To me at least, the point of playing rpgs is primary to just hang out with people and play a game together. I think games are important, they are a social lubricant and nothing brings people together like something 
                    niche they all care about.

                    I won't promise that zero conflicts will happen, but I do promise I'll try to take care of things as they do come up. We'll run with basic safety tools in every game and I'll check in with people if something seems amiss
                    and you can always come talk to me if I missed something or if there's a dyamic I am missing between you and myself or you and another player, or if you just wanna chat.

                    My games are meant to be lighter affairs in terms of the time you are expected to invest in it outside of the session. If you are really vibing with it or have a cool character concept for a setting theme you want to explore,
                    defintely chat with me or with the group on discord. Share your thoughts! Otherwise, you aren't expected to spend a bunch of time reading or trying to keep up with anything. I want to play with people who don't normally have time
                    to play the types of rpg campaigns that demand 20+ sessions to complete a story. 

                    If you do want to do a bunch of writing about something or have a cool idea, please share it! That's rad, I won't ever stomp on your passions.

                    2. Open table games

                    The main mode of organizing games on my discord server is 'open table'. Generally, there's a map and history and conflict (and probably one big main dungeon) and the players are meant to self-organize adventuers and expeditions
                    to somewhere on the map and characters are generally meant to get back to safety after every play session. Groups don't need to persist if they don't want to.

                    These expectations, in my experience, don't tend to come together until after we've gotten several games in. For your first session, I'll probably find you a group to play with and point you in the direction of a few goals
                    and we'll go from there. No prep is needed beforehand. You are welcome to read up on the setting (I promise to keep the notes pretty short).

                    An important note is there is no story outside of the one we're crafting together. The narrative will come together as various groups play and explore the land. 

                    3. Character death

                    One factor in the games I like to run is I like to kill characters. Errrr, I mean. Well, it's not untrue. We're generally going to play games where your characters stay pretty vulnerable and you need to take active
                    means to stay alive. I'll try to telegraph danger, but deaths to happen, and every player in the game right now has had at least 1 character die. 

               		This is also why I'll make it fast and easy to generate a new character, and importantly to me, the deaths that have happened are <em>part of the story</em>. Character victories, struggles, and deaths are the narratives
               		that we are constructing together. 

               		I fully understand that this won't appeal to every player, but I'd rather you know up front what you are getting into.

               		4. The setting

               		The game takes place in a small province in a larger world. The larger world is less fleshed out than the region is, and it will likely be developed more as we play.

               		Right now, what's important for you to know is the region we're playing is very basic fantasy for the most part. It's got elves, dwarves, humans, halflings, etc, along with orcs, goblins, beastmen, and the like. The primnaryu
               		religon (if you can call it that) of the area is based on the ancient greek pantheon and mythologies.

               		Some other important bits for you to know are:

               		1. The world is full of black and brown people, including elves, dwarves, gnomes, and etc.
               		2. There are lots of gay, trans, ace, polyam, aro, and maybe even some straight folks if we're feelin' wild. This is going to be the default
               		3. There might be groups that are projections of real-life shitty groups in the world today but those groups won't have goals based on real-life cultural groups. There's not going to be racists, sexists, or antisemities,
               		but there might be groups that hate sex and masturbation and fantasy species-ists. 
               		4. "Monsterous" races are people. There's no default evil/chaotic people here.
               		5. The world (this region at least) uses Greek mythology, but the gods are as distant as they are in our world. You aren't going to see Zeus walking around trying to fuck a sheep. I think the concept of greek mysteries
               		and heresies in general to be interesting, so plan to see some of that. Some myths might be recontextualized to fit in the setting but feel free to include any obsucure greek myths that you know. I am not expert on the matter,
               		this has just sort of happened and I am rolling with it. 
               		6. Clerics don't dedicate themselves to a specific deity, since that doesn't really make sense for a polythetisitc society. I've been writing some alternate rules for this and those may come up later.
					7. Slavers do exist in this settings, feel free to try to murder them. Heck, feel inspiried to try to take down any evil organization in the settings, 
					whether or not it appears to you to be an explict plot hook. (Hint, there are no plot hooks)
