                    <h1>RPG INFO</h1>
                    <p>If you are reading this, then Xtina has probably decided she wants to play an rpg with you. Congrats!</p>
                    <h2>1. Expectations (for you and your GM)</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Games are for chilling with my buds</h3>
                    <p>I play RPGs primarily to hang out with people. I love telling stories alongside people and doing crunchy shit, but for me it's a means to hangout with people I love or want to get to know better.</p>
                    <h3>Let's not avoid conflict</h3>
                    <p>Conflicts may come up: I'd prefer to be a table where conflict is addressed rather than avoided. Please talk or message me if I am missing a vibe during the game or something is bugging you.</p>
                    <h3>Always safety tools</h3>
                    <p>We'll always play with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit">x-cards</a> by default.</p>
                    <h3>Low commitment affairs</h3>
                    <p>My games tend to be lighter affairs and generally you do not need to do prep beforehand and you do not need to commit to playing more than one game. I'd love you to come back, but let's just play one fun session together to start.</p>
                    <h3>I'll organize games but help me out later</h3>
                    <p>If we haven't played before, I'll organize a time for you to play and get you connected with people who I think you will like. After we've played for a bit, I would love if you would start coordinating your own sessions. You'll understand what I mean once we play a bit.</p>
                    <h3>Tell me your cool idea</h3>
                    <p>If you do want to do a bunch of writing about something or have a cool idea, please share it! That's rad, I won't ever stomp on your passions.</p>

                    <h2>2. Open Table Games</h2>
                        
                    <h3></h3>
                    <p>The main way I am running games right now is an 'open table'. Rather than there being one group of players who the game is played for, players can self-organize and play in whatever adventures they want. Generally there is one big map or dungeon
                    <p>The main mode of organizing games on my discord server is 'open table'. Generally, there's a map and history and conflict (and probably one big main dungeon) and the players are meant to self-organize adventures and expeditions to somewhere on the map and characters are generally meant to get back to safety after every play session.</p>
                    <p>These expectations, in my experience, don't tend to come together until after we've gotten several games in.For your first session, I'll probably find you a group to play with and point you in the direction of a few goals and we'll go from there. No prep is needed beforehand. You are welcome to read up on the setting (I promise to keep the notes pretty short).</p>
                    <p>An important note is there is no story outside of the one we're crafting together. The narrative will come together as various groups play and explore the land.</p> 

                    <h2>3. Principles for "OSR"-style play</h2>
                    
                    <a href="https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html">This document</a> is a big inspriation in how I like to run games these days. I recommend reading the player principles at the end of the document at least.                   
                        
                    <h2>Addendum: Character Death</h2>
                    <sup>I always accidentally write "player death" when I mean to write "character death". What does that say about me?</sup>
                    
                    <h3>Your character has a not-insignificant chance to die</h3>
                    <p>One factor in the games I like to run is I like to kill characters. Errrr, I mean. Well, it's not untrue. We're generally going to play games where your characters stay pretty vulnerable and you need to take active
                    means to stay alive. I'll telegraph danger, but deaths to happen, and every player in the game right now has had at least 1 character die.</p>
                    <h3>This is why new characters are quick to make</h3>
               		<p>This is also why I'll make it fast and easy to generate a new character, and importantly to me, the deaths that have happened are <em>part of the story</em>. Character victories, struggles, and deaths are the narratives that we are constructing together.</p> 
                    <h3>Sorry in advance</h3>
               		<p>I fully understand that this won't appeal to every player, but I'd rather you know up front what you are getting into.</p>
                       
               		<h2>4. The setting</h2>

               		<p>The game takes place in a small province in a larger world. The larger world is less fleshed out than the region is, and it will likely be developed more as we play.

               		<p>Right now, what's important for you to know is the region we're playing is very basic fantasy for the most part. It's got elves, dwarves, humans, halflings, etc, along with orcs, goblins, beastmen, and the like. The primnary
                           
                           
                    <h2>5. Gazetteer</h2>
                    <h3>How to use</h3>
                    <p>This is meant to be a reference for the local, playable regions of the game. Phaedra is where most of the game will take place for now. You are free to create a character from one of these regions, or from somewhere else if you feeling like making something up.</p>
                    <p>Any info here is general knowledge that your characters probably know about the world</p>
                    <p>If you decide to play as a non-human or a unqiue character, I might have more world details to share with you privately.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Phaedra</h3>

                    <h5>Argope</h5>
                    <p>A fishing town. Most notable for being the closest launching off point for the so-called Murder Island. Currently occupied by the Cult of Apollo, a regressive, militant cult dedicated to preserving purity and masculinity.</p>

                    A large, misted island located near Argope that used to be connected by a land-bridge to the mainland. Rumors say that an ancient ruins lies at the heart of the tropical island, but few have survived to tell any stories about it. Rarely, Lizardfolk and Beastmen will leave the island, usually looking for mercenary work.

                    <p>The base of the Cult of Apollo</p>

                    <h5>Pan's Forest</h5>

                    <h3>Dolemnwood</h3>
                    Phaedra: A city-state, like an ancient greek city-state evolved to more classic fantasy (iron, etc.)
                        Northern Covenent: City-state, more witchy and euro than Phaedra. Church of Hekate opposed to Cult of Apollo. Borders Dolemnwood, gets some of it's magic-y weirdness from there.
                        Dolemnwood. You know, a big british/euro forest fae region. As big as a country. 
                        Thracia: A lost civilization, the dregs still live on in a large island off the coast of Phaedra. 
                        
                        1. Gazetteer       
               		religon (if you can call it that) of the area is based on the ancient greek pantheon and mythologies.

               		Some other important bits for you to know are:

               		1. The world is full of black and brown people, including elves, dwarves, gnomes, and etc.
               		2. There are lots of gay, trans, ace, polyam, aro, and maybe even some straight folks if we're feelin' wild. This is going to be the default
               		3. There might be groups that are projections of real-life shitty groups in the world today but those groups won't have goals based on real-life cultural groups. There's not going to be racists, sexists, or antisemities,
               		but there might be groups that hate sex and masturbation and fantasy species-ists. 
               		4. "Monsterous" races are people. There's no default evil/chaotic people here.
               		5. The world (this region at least) uses Greek mythology, but the gods are as distant as they are in our world. You aren't going to see Zeus walking around trying to fuck a sheep. I think the concept of greek mysteries
               		and heresies in general to be interesting, so plan to see some of that. Some myths might be recontextualized to fit in the setting but feel free to include any obsucure greek myths that you know. I am not expert on the matter,
               		this has just sort of happened and I am rolling with it. 
               		6. Clerics don't dedicate themselves to a specific deity, since that doesn't really make sense for a polythetisitc society. I've been writing some alternate rules for this and those may come up later.
					7. Slavers do exist in this settings, feel free to try to murder them. Heck, feel inspiried to try to take down any evil organization in the settings, 
					whether or not it appears to you to be an explict plot hook. (Hint, there are no plot hooks)

                    2. "Murder" Island. A large, misted island located off the coast of Argope.
